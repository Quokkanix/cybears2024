        <h1>Panda's Writeups</h1>
        <p>Some bsides 24 writeups done by a noob who has only used a computer once before.</p>

        <h2 id="puzzled">Puzzled</h2>
        <p>This one brought back flashbacks of last year's crossword puzzle. It quickly became apparant that it wasn't the same style though because 1) It was in the rev section, and 2) some of the clues made zero sense and there was no way to get some of them anyway, as the letters had no clue attached</p>
        <p>Now I tried a bunch of stupid stuff so I won't list it all here, but I played around with other .puz scramblers, banged my head on a wall a bit, read through https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/txt/acre.html for too long, went to abuse the author but he was too nice, took some panadol for the headache this ctf gave me, then then I decided to jump on what one of my team mates was doing (dgl a super smart guy from melbourne who is 100 times leeter than me. He was playing with curl and stuff and I'll show you why.. </p>
    <p><img src='puz1.png'><img src='puz2.png'></p>
        <p>So the key is generated client side.. cool cool cool no doubt no doubt let's play with curl and throw shit at the wall and see what sticks</p>
        <div class="code-box">
    <code>
curl.exe 'http://puzzled.chal.cybears.io:5000/puz_encode' -H 'Content-type: application/octet-stream' -H 'Origin: http://puzzled.chal.cybears.io:5000/' -H 'Puz-Code: 5442' -H 'Puz-Height: 4' -H 'Puz-Width: 4' --data-raw "ABCDABCDABCDABCD" -v  --insecure

        That got me back UVSTUVSTVSTUVSTU. Now, I only used 4 different chars in what I sent, and they were all sequential. The chars I got back were sequentialish too. If I send all of one letter, I'd only get one letter back. 
<br><Br>
        I started getting an idea on how to solve it. I figured if I had the original puzzle, used the key and downloaded a scramble, it would give me the same .puz file as we had been given, right? Now, I already knew some of the right letters.. so I tried this:

        <p>So, that got me back RRRRRR...........RRRRRRR.....RRRRRRRRRRR.....R.RRRRR...........RRRRR..R...RRRRR...RRRRR...R..R...R...RRRRR...R...R..R...R...R...R...R...R..RRR.R...R...R...R.RRR.R..RRR...R...T...RVR..RRRR.RRRRRRRRRRRURRR.XRRRRR.RRRRRR...RRRRRR.RRRRRR.R.RRR.....RRR.R.RRRRRR.R..R.......R..R.RRRRRR.R..R.......R..R.RRRRRR.R..R.......R..R.RRRRRR.R..R.......R..R.RRRRRR.RR.R.......R.RW.RRRRRRR.RRR.......RRR.RRRRRRRRR..R.RRRSR.R..RRRRRRRRRR..RRR...RRR..RRRRRRRRRRR...........RRRRRR* <br><Br>Zs became R's.. ABCDEF became STUVWX and put in different locations.. AND they matched what was in those spots in the .puz file given to us.. ok.. ok.. very good my dear watson! I knew what to do! I was a panda with a plan! A monkey on a mission! I went through and worked out what the whole alphabet would translate too.. if an A was in the original crossword, it would become an S and be placed somewhere else on the new one. I knew what letters would turn into! I started writing a key (The blue being what letter I went to put in, the red being what it turned into..</p>

        <p>I put the letters A-O in the space of 81.. I knew what letter A would turn into.. I knew what letter B would turn into.. So I knew what letters went where .. <br><Br>RRR<b><u>B</u></b>RR...........RR<b><u>X</u></b>RRRR.....RR<b><u>T</u></b>RRRRRRRR.....R.RRRRR...........RRRRR..R...RRR<b><u>D</u></b>R...RRR<b><u>V</u></b>R...R..R...R...RRRRR...R...R..R...R...R...R...<b><u>G</u></b>...R..RRR.R...R...R...R.RRR.R..RRR...R...R...RRR..RRRR.RRRRRRR<b><u>U</u></b>RRRR<b><u>F</u></b>RR.RRRRRR.RRRRRR...RRRRRR.RRRRRR.R.RRR.....RRR.R.RRRRRR.R..R.......R..<b><u>W</u></b>.RRRRRR.R..R.......R..R.RR<b><u>Z</u></b>RR<b><u>A</u></b>.R..R.......R..R.RRRRRR.<b><u>S</u></b>..R.......R..R.RRRRRR.<b><u>C</u></b>R.R.......R.RR.<b><u>Y</u></b>RRRRRR.RRR.......RRR.RRRRRRRRR..R.RR<b><u>E</u></b>RR.R..RRRRRRRRRR..RRR...RRR..RRRRRRRRRRR...........RRRRRR
<br><br>So.. the first word came out at RRRBRR. Now I knew if something came out as a B, it would have been put in as a J. That means the 10th letter in '81 across' would appear as the 4th letter in the first row. In the .puz file we got though, it was meant to come out as a Y, which means I needed to have a G in the tenth place.</p>
        <p><img src='puz4.png'></p>
        <p>So, using my code, I worked out what the letters were for 81 across.. and that gave me the flag!</p>

    <p>All done! :) This felt so good to get! Though probably not the way we were meant to get it?</p>

        <h2 id="flagme">Flag Me Maybe</h2>
        <p>So this one, as soon as I opened it and i saw it was a gif of the maritime flag signally doober, I knew what to do. I opened the file up in photoshop so I could see it frame by frame. I was a little confused at first over the frames that had two people in them, but figured that was just for animation effects.<br><Br>I translated it all quite quickly except for two mistakes I was making<br><Br>1. I was including cybears in the flag (e.g. cybears{cybears_is_that_a...)<br>2. I had accidentally included an extra C at the end. So I kept trying to work out the meaning of it, not realising that it was part of the animation wrap to go at the beginning of the loop. I'm embarrased how long this one took me to get ...</p>

        <h2 id="tictactoe">Glitch Tac Toe</h2>
        <p>This one, you hop on and play some tic tac toe.. easy right? Well the first game was.. there were no 'glitches'</p>
<p> <img src='glitch1.png'></p>
    <p>I shall depict my mood with an emoji 😀
    <br><Br>I get to the next game and discover the first glitch. My first move was to go on spot 3 again, but it put me onto spot 2.. My first thought was 'maybe it's taking my move and subtracting it by one ... but the rest of my moves went into the correct spots.. so I managed to beat it.. My current mood: 🧐</p>
    <p><img src='glitch2.png'></p>
    <p>Okay so. Level three now .. It 'let' me play in my regular position 3.. no glitch there.. turns out your first spot always forced you to play in 3 on game three, but I missed that for far too long .. But yeah, level three was straight forward and easy ...My current mood: 😀</p>
    
    <p><img src='glitch3.png'></p>
    <p>So.. Level 4.. that text looks like rot.. okay.. I'll go in spot 3 again as usual.. but now I'm in 4! My mood: 😠.. until after a few do overs to realise that Game 2, 3, 4 and 5 would always force your play space into those squares as your first move.. okay.. okay.. I can do this! And I also understood that I didn't need to win, I just needed to not lose. Mood is now ☺️ </p>
     <p><img src='glitch4.png'></p>
      <p>Okay game 5, I know I'm going to start in spot 5.. The computer says they went in spot 2.. okay..  I can't see the board but I can write it down on one of the many free pads of paper that the convention center had (a whopping 5 pages per pad!). I choose spot 3.. and they go spot s.. uhhh.. okay I'll just play on, and lose of course. I do it a few times and lose again and again.. I go down a bit of a rabbit hole of trying to decode where the computer says it's going .. Feeling 😡😠😖.. </p>
     <p><img src='glitch5.png'></p>
      <p> I do know that it's showing me the game after I lose, and my spaces are always correct.. and then it hits me! Mood 🤯🤦🏻. I don't NEED to know where the computer is going.. I just need to prevent myself from losing, so I just need to place my X's in spaces where I can eliminate his ability to put 3-in-a-row. I also had a good guess of where the computer would go because he would try and block my moves .. after I realised that, the rest of the games were easy! :) My mood: 😄
